        "### Common Patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Counter Pattern:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",
        "    count = 0\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        MyClass.count += 1\n",
        "        self.id = MyClass.count\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Validated Property:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "@property\n",
        "def value(self):\n",
        "    return self._value\n",
        "\n",
        "@value.setter\n",
        "def value(self, v):\n",
        "    if v < 0:\n",
        "        raise ValueError(\"Must be positive\")\n",
        "    self._value = v\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Alternative Constructor:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "@classmethod\n",
        "def from_string(cls, s):\n",
        "    # Parse string\n",
        "    return cls(parsed_values)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "**For your project:**\n",
        "1. Set up your branching workflow\n",
        "2. Practice creating PRs and reviewing code\n",
        "3. Identify what should be class vs instance attributes\n",
        "4. Use properties for any validated data\n",
        "5. Create alternative constructors if useful\n",
        "\n",
        "**Practice exercises:**\n",
        "- Create a class with all three method types\n",
        "- Practice resolving merge conflicts with your team\n",
        "- Refactor existing code to use properties\n",
        "- Identify opportunities for class attributes\n",
